## Part 1 | the Fall

![[a.e.basol_Nine_aspects_fallen_into_earth_9b8246a5-4c38-46e4-82d7-dc82e5301c7a.png]]
High above, in the endless void of the cosmos, a singular droplet radiated a mysterious luminance. This beacon of light, enigmatic and profound, beckoned the Nine Forms, the children of Narya, drawing them toward its glow. Drawn by an unknown force, they descended upon Earth, each plummeting to a different corner of this vast and varied world.

The impact of their arrival was monumental. Mountains shifted, seas roared, and the very fabric of the Earth trembled. Each Form, shaped by the unique essence they carried from Narya, now found themselves isolated in a realm unknown, their siblings nowhere in sight. They fell different parts of earth. 

Disoriented by their sudden arrival, each Form sensed an inexplicable pull towards the others, even though they didn't truly understand or recognize each other. It was a connection not of memory, but of a deeper, primordial understanding, like fragments longing to form a whole. They wandered, driven by that unyielding pull, creating pathways, shaping landscapes, and leaving signs only the others could perceive.

Amidst the restless wanderings of the Eight, there was one who chose a different path. Instead of searching for the others, this Form found solace atop a towering mountain peak. Here, amidst the whispers of the wind and the vast canvas of the skies, it sought clarity. With a panoramic view of the world below, this Form closed its eyes and delved deep into its own essence, yearning to understand the purpose of their existence and the origin of their descent. While the others left marks and pathways on the Earth, this one journeyed inward, traversing the realms of memories and feelings. As it delved deeper, its powers began to unravel further, revealing glimpses of the past and echoes of Narya. With each revelation, the desire to trace back to their origin grew stronger. This Form's quest wasn't just about understanding their journey to Earth, but about unveiling the very fabric of their existence. This turmoil was not just internal; it started to manifest outwardly. The once-lush mountaintop began to wither, the plants desiccated, and the very essence of life seemed to be drained from the vicinity. Such was the intensity of this Form's struggle that it resonated far and wide. The very fabric of nature vibrated with its anguish, sending ripples across the world. This disturbance created a pull more potent than the innate connection the siblings shared. Sensing this distress, the remaining eight Forms felt an undeniable urge to converge on this mountain.

the Eight approached with a mix of trepidation and anticipation. The world around them seemed to resonate with the very pulse of their distressed kin, and they could feel the weight of her torment with every step they took. As they climbed, each terrain they crossed reflected the emotional tumult of the Form atop the mountain - barren land, scorched trees, and an eerie silence that echoed the depth of her inner turmoil. Reaching the summit was like stepping into a different realm. The Form at the peak, her eyes closed, was surrounded by a luminous aura, the intensity of which fluctuated with her emotions. Her energy, wild and uncontained, created swirling patterns in the air, each shimmering thread depicting fragments of memories, sounds, and emotions from the very core of the universe, the Center.

Her siblings neared the distressed Form atop the mountain, their senses were inundated by the raw and chaotic energies she was emanating. It was a call, not of recognition, but of urgency. Even without knowing her, they felt an intrinsic need to help, to protect. It was as if the universe itself whispered to them, urging them to act, an innate understanding blossomed within them.

One by one, the Eight approached, instinctively forming a circle around their kin. Drawn together by an impulse they couldn't understand, they began to channel their own energies. These energies wove together, intertwining in a harmonious dance, creating a gentle flow that began to counteract the tumultuous storm surrounding the Form at the center. Their combined essence acted not just as a soothing balm, but as a shield, a defense against the harmful repercussions of the chaotic power she had unwittingly unleashed. And with their combined strength and unity, they managed to halt the cascade of unbridled energy, bringing serenity back to the mountaintop and safeguarding their sibling from her own overwhelming power.

Her eyes snapped open, revealing a raw, intense energy. A guttural and primal sound echoed from her, a sound of frustration and anguish, signaling her disturbance at their interruption. Her every movement was charged with emotion, the air around her pulsating with her distress. The shimmering threads that surrounded her were wild, their patterns chaotic. It was clear she had been on the verge of a profound revelation about the truth, but their arrival had disrupted the delicate balance she was trying to achieve. 

The tension on the mountaintop was palpable. As the Eight surrounded their distressed sibling, they could sense the depth of her turmoil. The desolation around them – the withered plants, scorched earth, and lifeless terrain – served as a testament to her unbridled power and the havoc it had wrought. One of the Aspect, with an essence that mirrored the Earth's nurturing spirit, gently reached down and pulled a wilted plant from its roots. Holding it up for all to see, it let the lifeless plant crumble away to dust. Then, placing its hands back into the soil, it channeled its energy into the ground. Before their eyes [alder](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fturkiyedekiagaclar.weebly.com%2Fkizila286accedil.html&psig=AOvVaw37o8bgA6KnE36VAN67CSLW&ust=1692635976470000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCKDzhMPW64ADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAI) as it was known, sprouted in place of the withered plant. Its vibrant leaves rustling gently in the breeze, standing as a symbol of rebirth and renewal. Inspired by this act, the other seven Aspects followed suit. One by one, they each uprooted a dead plant and, with a touch filled with intention and care, replaced it with a alder. The mountaintop was soon adorned with these trees, their red leaves forming a vivid contrast against the backdrop of the desolate landscape, symbolizing hope amidst despair.

The ninth Form, seated on the ground and overwhelmed by her emotions, watched as her siblings transformed the landscape. Tears streamed down her face, reflecting a mix of sorrow for the destruction she had caused and gratitude for the compassion her siblings showed. Her tears spoke volumes, each drop carrying the weight of her remorse and longing for understanding. The Eight, sensing the change in her demeanor, gathered closer, creating a protective circle around her. They didn't need words; their actions spoke louder, conveying their unwavering support and unity.

## Part 2 | Genesis of Creation

![[a.e.basol_white_skinned_human_creates_a_human_from_dirt_and_wat_5c92b87b-1bae-4577-a293-60b3c2875c16.png]]
In the aftermath of the dramatic unification atop the mountain, the Aspects explored the world further, discovering that they could harness the power of the rünventus winds to mold the land and part the waters, creating rivers and valleys. They spoke to animals that roamed the vast expanses, and danced with trees that stood tall and proud. Their unity and purpose were stronger than ever, and their capabilities seemed limitless.

Writer's note:
Rünventus is a magical wind that enchantes Aspect or magic wielders power. It is very crucial for magic based characters.

One day, as the Creation Aspect gazed deep into the blue expanse of the ocean, an idea sparked in his mind. He envisioned creatures of purpose, with thoughts as deep as the ocean's depths and desires as vast as the skies. He called upon his siblings, the other Aspects, and shared his vision. Together, they began their divine craft, drawing from the very essences of the world around them.

**Humans:** From the resilient stalks of wheat and the lustrous allure of gold, humans took their first breath. These beings bore the resilience of the land and held an inner shine that would guide their many endeavors.

**Elfians:** From the inky mysteries of the sea and the soft touch of leather, Elfians were woven into existence. Their souls deep and introspective, their bond with the land undeniable.

**Hobban:** A whisper of leaves and the playful dance of dandelions birthed the Hobban. Small in stature but immense in heart, their spirit was as free as the wind carrying the seeds of their symbolic dandelion.

**Ocran:** Carved from the resolute stone and forged with malleable iron, the Orcor stood tall. They were a testament to strength and honor, unwavering yet adaptable.

**Navidan:** With feathers as delicate as dreams and essence as light as clouds, the Navidans emerged. A harmonious blend of sky and sea, they tread both realms with grace.

**Valkan:** The skies echoed with joy as the Valkan, with wings borrowed from the mightiest birds and the ethereal magic of the air, soared high. Freedom was their song, the skies their dance floor.

Once shaped, they call the created ones the Beser, began to explore the wonders of their world. They sang songs of the forests, danced with the winds, and dreamt dreams only beings of thought could. The Aspects, having breathed life into their creations, watched from the shadows, their hearts swelling with pride.

Yeah, we inspired Beser from "Beşeri" in Turkish.
