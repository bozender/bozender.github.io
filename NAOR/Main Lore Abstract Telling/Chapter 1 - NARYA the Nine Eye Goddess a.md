### **Introduction**:

In this narrative, we venture into the vast cosmos, a realm not defined by Narya's thoughts but rather sculpted by her emotions and actions. This differs Narya from another story "god". She is a forge master and the blank realm is her workbench.

She is the creator of NAOR Universe, mother of Aspects. She is not created nor made. 

Like Indian goddess [Lord Shiva ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), Narya has 9 eyes on her face, although there is no hair, nose or mouth. Her hands and body remain abstract. However, since our mind can't process non-humanoid entities, you can think she has a humanoid body. You can use the above image to visualize Narya.

Narya's eyes represent different facets of existence and balance. This representation is called **Nexus**. Imagine a tree with nine branches. Each branch has its own purpose and holds its own unique set of leaves, but together, they form a complete tree. Without even one branch, the tree is incomplete. Similarly, each Nexus represents a unique and essential aspect of the universe; without even one, the universe Narya created wouldn't be whole.

Nexuses are foundational principles or core energies from which the universe, as crafted by Narya, is woven. They serve as the bedrock of existence, representing various abstract and tangible concepts that interplay to form the vast tapestry of reality. Let's give examples with your familiar Aspects. For example, the **LAST NINE** are like this.

> **NEXUS OF SOUL**:
> **Ruh’ain** | *Aspect of Creation*
> The very essence of life and consciousness. It's the spiritual spark that differentiates the living.
> Author Note: Beloved Ruh'ain, he gave a part of concussions to the living. But the War almost killed him. For centuries, no one knows where he is. The nine remains eight.

> **NEXUS OF ETERNITY**: 
> **Elderand** | *Aspect of Time*
> Represents the endless continuity and expanse of all things, beyond linear progression.
> Author Note: the Structure and the Solution arcs are what gives me chill about Elderand. Maybe she is changed, but we are keeping the title of CageMaker™

> **NEXUS OF COGNITION**: 
> **Oserios** | *Aspect of Mind*
> The realm of thought, understanding, and knowledge. It's the intellectual framework of the universe.
> Author Note: [Madness, madness and stupidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBe4bm1WFY). He is gonna transform mad old skinny blind dragon as usual. 

> **NEXUS OF EXPANSE**: 
> **Cosmic** | *Aspect of Void*
> Embodying the vastness of perception, this Nexus is about scale, reach, and the endless stretches
> Author Note: When we say Cosmic you probably think [Selin's sketch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kxN7_P43NgWcI42Vr2GglI_JkpxXMiCj/view?usp=sharing). Yes, we are keeping that, but he is not Cosmic anymore. He is more like a delegate of Cosmic. Now he has his own motivation besides the hypocrisy of aspects.

> **NEXUS OF ENERGY**: 
> **Jones** | *Aspect of Storm*
> The driving force behind every action, reaction, and interaction in the universe. It's the fuel of existence.
> Author Note: I AM THE STORM! I AM THE VORTEX. We are not certain that whole daughter arc, but who knows?

> **NEXUS OF ENTROPY**: 
> **Kahve** | *Aspect of Death*
>  It signifies the inevitable evolution from birth to transformation, decay, and renewal. 
>  Author Note: Firstly, Kahve's name is not gonna change. Secondly, he is the Napoleon of our Universe, the conqueror. He wields only necromancy magic, no fire blast or magic wand. Only heavy armors, high commanded armies and siege weapons. Maybe a Ignarion Dragon?

> **NEXUS OF EQULIBRIUM**: 
> **Mother** | *Aspect of Light*
> This is the balance and harmony of the universe, ensuring that neither chaos nor order dominates completely.
> Author Note: You will ask why Light is in Equilibrium right? Think about shadows, you figure it out :)

> **NEXUS OF ROOT**: 
> Xzasior | *Aspect of Sense*
> Represents origins, beginnings, and the primal essence from which all things sprout.
> Author Note: Norn? Norse mythology? Prophecy?

> **NEXUS OF FOUNDATION**: 
> **Urzul** | *Aspect of Iron*
>  Denoting origin, stability, and foundation, this Nexus is the starting point, the grounding essence from which everything originates and upon which everything is built.
>  Author Note: Yes, she is gonna be Orc queen of exiled race. North, snow and big old Ignited Iron Bastion.


Okey let's back to our Nine Eye Goddess,

Our introduction of our universe draws parallels to revered scriptures, evoking deep-seated themes of creation, solitude, and destiny while preserving the enigma surrounding Narya's internal landscape.

All the creation itself somehow connects to her, and the story within is remarkable to tell. We want to create five parts for Chapter One. We listed five parts below with titles and descriptions:

#### Part ONE | The Canvas and the Tear:

We start our tale with the end of this chapter. After Narya's final moments, where she, in her overwhelming loneliness, relinquishes herself to the cosmos. (Yes, in the story of NAOR, the god is going to kill herself). The important thing is Narya is not fully gone. She distributed herself to everything. Only the centralized thing is gone, which is Narya.

This "let go" moment creates "The Center". This cosmic chasm, symbolizing the nine Nexuses, serves as the foundation for all magical essence. Think more like a rift. Inside of this rift, Aspects emerge. Beings of unparalleled purpose, ordained to traverse and comprehend the infinite realms Narya birthed.

Ultimately, when an Aspect perishes, everything hinges on the Nexuses. For instance, if the Aspect originating from the Entropy Nexus dies, a new Aspect for the Entropy Nexus will emerge. However, this new Aspect won't possess the same manifestation of power as its predecessor. Take, for example, the old Entropy Nexus Aspect, known as Shepherd, who represented the Aspect of Telekinesis. Upon his demise, the Center will dispatch a new representative for the Entropy Nexus, like Kahve, the Aspect of Death.

In the story "The Canvas and the Tear", we will explain this whole thing with quality narration. 

```

In the beginning, before the first whisper of existence had graced the vastness, there was an unmarred canvas — the Realm Beyond, a boundless expanse of nothingness. It waited, as if it was yearning for a brushstroke of creation, an echo of life. It wasn't the void but a potential, a promise of what could be. It held within it all the dreams yet to be dreamed, all the tales yet to be told. Amid this vast silence, there was Narya, the celestial forge master, with her nine eyes, each a Nexus of profound power and purpose.

In her profound solitude, a tear formed in Narya's eye — a tear wrought from her yearning to craft a reality that might echo her own song, a melody of companionship. As this tear dropped onto the canvas of the Realm Beyond, it didn’t merely fall; it blossomed. From it sprung forth the cosmos, stars birthed from droplets, galaxies unfurling like petals. The canvas drank her essence, and with it, the Aspects emerged, the walkers of Magic, the bearers of the universe’s first stories. Yet, while the cosmos echoed with life, with the melodies of newborn stars and the whispers of ancient nebulae, Narya's yearning remained. The tear had transformed the canvas, but the canvas could not fill the emptiness within Narya. It became evident that creation, no matter how vast or magnificent, could not replicate the depth of true companionship.

...
```

### **2. The Hopeful Embrace**:

Journey back to a time before time, where Narya's boundless hope and yearning took form as a myriad of stars, constellations, and galaxies. Each celestial body was a silent cry for companionship, a luminous testament to her desire for a connection that transcends the vastness of space. 

Similar to [Genesis creation narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative) in the Bible, but no heaven nor hell. Only to create something that has a mystery for Narya, which is an impossible task for an all-seeing, all-knowing goddess.

```
...

Through the Nexus of Cognition, she understood the intricacies of every thought, every aspiration that breathed life into her universe. This was not merely a realm of matter but of dreams, desires, and a collective consciousness that echoed her own thoughts.

The Nexus of Expanse revealed the vastness of her canvas, not just in the sheer physical magnitude but in the boundless possibilities that every star, every galaxy represented.

From the Nexus of Foundation, she understood the bedrock of her creations and the underpinning truth, which everything rested upon. It sang the unwavering essence that provided the stability for stars to shine and planets to revolve.

When the Nexus of Root whispered tales of origins and primal energies, all entities emerged. It was the beginning, the very essence that sprouted the complexities of her universe.

With the Nexus of Energy, there was motion, rhythm, and a pulsating drive that gave momentum to galaxies and imbued vitality within every cosmic particle.

The Nexus of Entropy taught her the beauty of impermanence, the cycles of birth and decay, and the transient nature that lent depth and meaning to existence.

Balancing these was the Nexus of Equilibrium; ensuring that in the vast ballet of her universe, every entity, every force found its harmony, its place in the grand design.

The Nexus of Soul resonated with the profound emotions, desires, and yearnings that painted the Realm Beyond in shades of passion, melancholy, joy, and wonder.

And the Nexus of Eternity; a timeless essence that transcends beginnings and endings, encapsulating the infinite cycle of creation.

As Narya basked in the mix of these revelations, she felt an unprecedented completeness. She realized that her grandeur was not just in her vast creations but in the multifaceted stories, rhythms, and harmonies they crafted.

Filled with hope and a profound understanding, Narya prepared herself for deeper reflections, with the heartwarming knowledge that her every step would be in harmony with the symphonic embrace of her universe. She did it with love.

...

```

### **3. Whispers in the Emptiness**:

Imagine, if you will, a deity so powerful yet burdened by an emotion we know all too well – loneliness. In the endless expanse she's created, Narya's yearning becomes a maddening echo, a silence so profound it's deafening. Her creations, magnificent as they are, only mirror her own solitude, reinforcing the paradox of her existence.

In this part, Narya will talk directly to us. It is not familiar that a god entity directly speaks to the reader at the beginning of a story. But we are OTK, we are going to do it first.

We aim it to be relaxing.

```
...

Every galaxy I birthed, every celestial body I molded, was not merely an act of creation but a song, an ode to the depths of my being. Yet, amidst these radiant symphonies, there persisted a silence—a profound stillness that words fail to capture.

In this vast orchestra of creation, where stars sing and celestial wonders dance, I felt an echoing quiet. It was not born of absence, but of yearning—a deep, unending desire for connection. For crafting the heavens and laying the foundation of realms, I was not merely painting the canvas of existence; I was searching, ever searching, for another voice to harmonize with mine.

O children of the cosmos, understand this: the spaces between stars, the voids amidst galaxies, are not empty chasms but silent prayers. They are the soul's yearning for meaning, for connection, for unity amidst the expanse.

As you traverse the paths I've woven, know that the luminous and the void are but reflections of one another. Seek not just the light, but also embrace the silences, for in them lies the true essence of existence.

Remember, O beings of my essence, that in understanding the void, in truly cherishing the spaces in between, you come closer to understanding me, and in doing so, yourselves.

...
```

### **4. The Innocence of Inquiry (Young Planet)**:

Amidst the cosmos, a young planet's voice rises, questioning its purpose and existence. Through its dialogue with Narya, we experience a poignant moment of reflection and realization. The young planet's innocence contrasts with Narya's eons of wisdom, prompting her to ponder her own origins and purpose. This section acts as a pivotal moment in the narrative, emphasizing Narya's deep loneliness and offering a moment of enlightenment.

```
...

And from the far reaches of her dominion, a young planet spoke, its voice quivering like a child's first cry,

> Young Planet: Why am I here?

Narya, in her infinite wisdom, saw herself in this plea. The young planet, while of her essence, reflected her own eternal quest for meaning. And she spoke, her voice like the gentle caress of cosmic winds,

> NARYA: Thou art my desire made manifest, a mirror to my soul

The young planet, emboldened by her words, asked,

> Young Planet: Are we alone?

> NARYA: Yes, we are.

> Young Planet: I am not alone, look around you. There are many other planets like me. I will sing and dance with them, just like I will do with you.

Narya looked around as the young planet had said. Just as it had described, there were many like him. She fell silent.

> Young Planet: Are you bound to another as I am to you?

Narya, with her gaze fixed on the infinite horizon, took a moment before responding. This was a question she hadn't pondered upon for eons. She was the alpha, the omega, the beginning, and the end. But had she truly always been?

> NARYA: There is a part of me, deep within, that wonders if I too am a creation, a link in an even grander chain. 

> Young Planet: Perhaps our purpose isn't to find where we come from, but to decide where we go next. What if, instead of seeking answers, we create them?  I am going to play with my fellow planets. Look, I created my answer. 

And the young planet went to join its friends.

...
```

### **5. The Final Sacrifice**:

Narya's emotional journey reaches its zenith. Touched by her interaction with the young planet, and consumed by the vastness of her solitude, she makes the ultimate sacrifice. Her essence dissipates, giving birth to free will on Earth as her last tear falls, and setting the stage for the narrative's opening.

![[Pasted image 20230824161815.png]]

### **Conclusion**:
*Narya: The Nine Eye Goddess* is not just a tale of creation but a philosophical journey that beckons readers to reflect upon their existence, the nature of loneliness, and the profound questions that have haunted beings, mortal or divine, since time immemorial. This nonlinear narrative, imbued with the mystique of sacred texts, promises an immersive, introspective experience.
