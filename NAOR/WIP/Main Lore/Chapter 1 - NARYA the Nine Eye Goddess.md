#### Authors Note about Chapter 1

We want to start our lore with a kind of a fairy tale story. Don't expect any logic based -even in magic- telling. We have created our inception this way.

In the universe of NAOR, "Narya" means everything inside of nothingness.

Abstract Image of NARYA
```
# Narya the Nine Eye Goddess

In the Beginning, before time itself had taken its first breath, before the vast void knew its name, there was Narya—the Nine-Eyed, the Weaver of Realities, the Shaper of Existences. Her gaze spanned eternities, with galaxies swirling within her orbs, shedding light that would awaken stars and banish the deepest voids.

In the Realm Beyond, where silence was the only truth, Narya's heart whispered a prayer—a yearning for another. She sought another voice to echo in the emptiness, another soul to share her boundless expanse. Every attempt to craft a companion proved futile. How could she fashion another being from the void when there was nothing to mold, no clay to shape?

Thus, in her divine sorrow, Narya birthed the cosmos. From her thoughts emerged stars, from her dreams sprouted planets, and with every sigh, galaxies were born. But the light of each star, the dance of every planet, mirrored only her own eternal solitude. She saw only her reflection.

Silence enveloped her. It wasn't just the absence of sound, but the absence of connection, of shared laughter and whispered secrets. While she could craft realities and forge new dimensions, the one thing she couldn't create was another voice apart from hers, another heartbeat that would echo in harmony with hers. So Narya did something unprecedented. She chose to listen her own voice. She leaned into the hum of the planets, the melodies of the stars, and the symphonies of galaxies. For what could they tell her that she didn’t already know? Yet, she listened.

# Young Planet

To her surprise, when she truly listened, the planets began to hum stories of their landscapes, of dancing auroras, and the silent ballet of their moons. The stars sang of blazing comets and delicate nebulae that painted their surroundings. Even though these were tales woven from her own essence, the act of listening, of truly hearing them, brought nuances she hadn’t perceived before.

And from the far reaches of her dominion, a young planet spoke, its voice quivering like a child's first cry,

> **Young Planet:** Why am I here?

Narya, in her infinite wisdom, saw herself in this plea. The young planet, while of her essence, reflected her own eternal quest for meaning. And she spoke, her voice like the gentle caress of cosmic winds,

> **NARYA:** Thou art my desire made manifest, a mirror to my soul

The young planet, emboldened by her words, asked,

> **Young Planet:** Are we alone?

> **NARYA:** Yes we are

> **Young Planet:** I am not alone, look around you. There are many other planets like me. I will sing and dance with them, just like I will with you

Narya looked around as the young planet had said. Just as it had described, there were many like him. She fell silent.

> **Young Planet:** Are you bound to another as I am to you?

Narya, with her gaze fixed on the infinite horizon, took a moment before responding. This was a question she hadn't pondered upon for eons. She was the alpha, the omega, the beginning, and the end. But had she truly always been?

> **NARYA:** There is a part of me, deep within, that wonders if I too am a creation, a link in an even grander chain. 

> **Young Planet:** Perhaps our purpose isn't to find where we come from, but to decide where we go next. What if, instead of seeking answers, we create them?  I am going to play with my fellow planets. Look, I create my answer. 

And the young planet went to join its friends.

Watching the young planet go off, Narya felt a mixture of admiration and reflection. The planet's innocence and determination had unexpectedly become a guiding light for her own existential crisis. 

Narya felt a swell of emotions she hadn't anticipated. The weight of eons, the pain of loneliness, and the hope of a new beginning intertwined, creating a tumultuous storm within her. How could she, a being of infinite reach and power, feel so isolated amidst her own creation?

The epiphany was clear: True connection could only be felt when one was a part of something, not just an overseer. The infinite tapestry of existence she had woven, with all its intricacies and wonders, beckoned her to become a thread rather than just the weaver.

Gathering her strength, she began to chant an ancient cosmic melody, one that resonated with the very heartbeat of the universe. The harmonious notes ebbed and flowed, filling every corner of the cosmos. Stars pulsated in rhythm, galaxies swirled in dance, and the vast voids echoed with her tune.

And then, with a crescendo of energy that shook the very fabric of existence, she shattered. It wasn’t a mere explosion but a transformation – a metamorphosis of her very being. She became countless shards of radiant light, each fragment a repository of her memories, hopes, dreams, and wisdom.

These shards journeyed far and wide, becoming silent sentinels within stars, whispering winds on desolate planets, and even the very soul of burgeoning life forms. They danced in the auroras, bathed in the warmth of suns, and rested in the cold embrace of space. Each shard, while a piece of Narya, began crafting its own story, its own experience, independent yet eternally linked to the whole.

As the remnants of Narya's magnificent form dissolved, a particularly luminous tear, one that bore the essence of her very core, descended. This tear, from her central ninth eye, was a beacon of life and creation. Drawn to a blue-green planet, Earth, it held the promise of new stories, new wonders, and new beginnings.

In its wake, the universe felt the void of Narya's departure but also the warmth of her pervasive presence. No longer a distant deity, she became the breath of life, the song of stars, and the silent witness to every tale spun in the vast expanse of the cosmos.

## the Rift

This monumental act of Narya's dispersal created a rift in the cosmos, an echoing void. This gap in the fabric of existence bore an uncanny resemblance to an eye, its structure vast and intricate. At the heart of this cosmic eye shimmered a radiant white light, an ethereal beacon in the vast darkness. Within this luminescence, one could discern swirling silhouettes, shadows, and forms, ever-changing and mysterious.

At the center of this radiant luminescence was a pulsating singularity, a profound nexus through which the Aspects descended to Earth. Each Aspect represented a fragment of Narya's being, and more specifically, an eye of Narya. There were nine in total, echoing the nine eyes of the meta deity. Though the number of eyes remained constant, the tears that filled them were fluid, ever-changing, representing the ever-evolving nature of Narya's consciousness

Upon Narya's self-fragmentation, the first nine Aspects were propelled towards Earth, hurtling like meteors.
